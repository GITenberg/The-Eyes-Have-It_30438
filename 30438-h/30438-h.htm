<h1>THE EYES HAVE IT</h1>

<h2>By James McKimmey, Jr.</h2>

<p><small>Illustrated by Paul Orban</small></p></div></div>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Joseph Heidel</span> looked slowly
around the dinner table at
the five men, hiding his examination
by a thin screen of smoke from
his cigar. He was a large man with
thick blond-gray hair cut close to
his head. In three more months he
would be fifty-two, but his face and
body had the vital look of a man
fifteen years younger. He was the
President of the Superior Council,
and he had been in that post&mdash;the
highest post on the occupied planet
of Mars&mdash;four of the six years he
had lived here. As his eyes flicked
from one face to another his fingers
unconsciously tapped the table,
making a sound like a miniature
drum roll.</p>

<p>One. Two. Three. Four. Five.
Five top officials, selected, tested,
screened on Earth to form the
nucleus of governmental rule on
Mars.</p>

<p>Heidel's bright narrow eyes
flicked, his fingers drummed.
Which one? Who was the imposter,
the ringer? Who was the Martian?</p>

<p>Sadler's dry voice cut through the
silence: "This is not just an ordinary
meeting then, Mr. President?"</p>

<p>Heidel's cigar came up and was
clamped between his teeth. He
stared into Sadler's eyes. "No, Sadler,
it isn't. This is a very special
meeting." He grinned around the
cigar. "This is where we take
the clothes off the sheep and find
the wolf."</p>

<p>Heidel watched the five faces.
Sadler, Meehan, Locke, Forbes,
Clarke. One of them. Which one?</p>

<p>"I'm a little thick tonight," said
Harry Locke. "I didn't follow what
you meant."</p>

<p>"No, no, of course not," Heidel
said, still grinning. "I'll explain it."
He could feel himself alive at that
moment, every nerve singing, every
muscle toned. His brain was quick
and his tongue rolled the words out
smoothly. This was the kind of
situation Heidel handled best. A
tense, dramatic situation, full of atmosphere
and suspense.</p>

<p>"Here it is," Heidel continued,
"simply and briefly." He touched
the cigar against an ash tray, watching
with slitted shining eyes while
the ashes spilled away from the
glowing tip. He bent forward suddenly.
"We have an imposter
among us, gentlemen. A spy."</p>

<p>He waited, holding himself tense
against the table, letting the sting
of his words have their effect. Then
he leaned back, carefully. "And tonight
I am going to expose this imposter.
Right here, at this table."
He searched the faces again, looking
for a tell-tale twitch of a muscle,
a movement of a hand, a shading
in the look of an eye.</p>

<p>There were only Sadler, Meehan,
Locke, Forbes, Clarke, looking like
themselves, quizzical, polite, respecting.</p>

<p>"One of us, you say," Clarke said
noncommittally, his phrase neither
a question nor a positive statement.</p>

<p>"That is true," said Heidel.</p>

<p>"Bit of a situation at that," said
Forbes, letting a faint smile touch
his lips.</p>

<p>"Understatement, Forbes," Heidel
said. "Understatement."</p>

<p>"Didn't mean to sound capricious,"
Forbes said, his smile gone.</p>

<p>"Of course not," Heidel said.</p>

<p>Edward Clarke cleared his
throat. "May I ask, sir, how this
was discovered and how it was narrowed
down to the Superior Council?"</p>

<p>"Surely," Heidel said crisply.
"No need to go into the troubles
we've been having. You know all
about that. But how these troubles
originated is the important thing.
Do you remember the missionary
affair?"</p>

<p>"When we were going to convert
the Eastern industrial section?"</p>

<p>"That's right," Heidel said, remembering.
"Horrible massacre."</p>

<p>"Bloody," agreed John Meehan.</p>

<p>"Sixty-seven missionaries lost,"
Heidel said.</p>

<p>"I remember the Martian note
of apology," Forbes said. "'We
have worshipped our own God for
two-hundred thousand years. We
would prefer to continue. Thank
you.' Blinking nerve, eh?"</p>

<p>"Neither here nor there," Heidel
said abruptly. "The point is that no
one <i>knew</i> those sixty-seven men
were missionaries except myself and
you five men."</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Heidel watched</span> the faces
in front of him. "One case,"
he said. "Here's another. Do you
recall when we outlawed the free
selection system?"</p>

<p>"Another bloody one," said Sadler.</p>

<p>"Forty-eight victims in that
case," Heidel said. "Forty-eight
honorable colonists, sanctioned by
us to legally marry any couple on
the planet, and sent out over the
country to abolish the horrible free-love
situation."</p>

<p>"Forty-eight justices of the peace
dead as pickerels," Forbes said.</p>

<p>"Do you happen to remember
<i>that</i> note of apology?" Heidel
asked, a slight edge in his voice.
He examined Forbes' eyes.</p>

<p>"Matter of fact, yes," said Forbes,
returning Heidel's stare steadily.
"'You love your way, we'll love
ours.' Terribly caustic, what?"</p>

<p>"Terribly," said Heidel. "Although
that too is neither here nor
there. The point again, no one except
the six of us right here knew
what those forty-eight men were
sent out to do."</p>

<p>Heidel straightened in his chair.
The slow grating voice of Forbes
had taken some of the sharpness
out of the situation. He wanted to
hold their attention minutely, so
that when he was ready, the dramatics
of his action would be tense
and telling.</p>

<p>"There is no use," he said, "in
going into the details of the other
incidents. You remember them.
When we tried to install a free
press, the Sensible Art galleries, I-Am-A-Martian Day,
wrestling, and
all the rest."</p>

<p>"I remember the wrestling business
awfully well," said Forbes.
"Martians drove a wrestler through
the street in a yellow jetmobile.
Had flowers around his neck and a
crown on his head. He was dead, of
course. Stuffed, I think...."</p>

<p>"All right," snapped Heidel.
"Each one of our efforts to offer
these people a chance to benefit
from our culture was snapped off
at the bud. And only a leak in the
Superior Council could have caused
it. It is a simple matter of deduction.
There is one of us, here tonight,
who is responsible. And I am
going to expose him." Heidel's
voice was a low vibrant sound that
echoed in the large dining room.</p>

<p>The five men waited. Forbes, his
long arms crossed. Sadler, his eyes
on his fingernails. Meehan, blinking
placidly. Clarke, twirling his
thumbs. Locke, examining his cigarette.</p>

<p>"Kessit!" Heidel called.</p>

<p>A gray-haired man in a black
butler's coat appeared.</p>

<p>"We'll have our wine now,"
Heidel said. There was a slight
quirk in his mouth, so that his teeth
showed between his lips. The butler
moved methodically from place to
place, pouring wine from a silver
decanter.</p>

<p>"Now then, Kessit," Heidel said,
when the butler had finished,
"would you be kind enough to fetch
me that little pistol from the mantel
over there?" He smiled outwardly
this time. The situation was
right again; he was handling things,
inch by inch, without interruption.</p>

<p>He took the gun from the old
man's hands. "One thing
more, Kessit. Would you please
light the candles on the table and
turn out the rest of the lights in
the room. I've always been a romanticist,"
Heidel said, smiling
around the table. "Candlelight with
my wine."</p>

<p>"Oh, excellent," said Locke soberly.</p>

<p>"Quite," said Forbes.</p>

<p>Heidel nodded and waited
while the butler lit the candles and
snapped off the overhead lights.
The yellow flames wavered on the
table as the door closed gently behind
the butler.</p>

<p>"Now, then," Heidel said, feeling
the tingling in his nerves. "This,
gentlemen, is a replica of an antique
of the twentieth century. A
working replica, I might add. It
was called a P-38, if my memory
serves me." He held the pistol up
so that the candlelight reflected
against the glistening black handle
and the blue barrel.</p>

<p>There was a polite murmur as
the five men stretched forward to
look at the gun in Heidel's hands.</p>

<p>"Crude," Sadler said.</p>

<p>"But devilish-looking," Forbes
added.</p>

<p>"My hobby," Heidel said. "I
would like to add that not only do
I collect these small arms, but I am
very adept at using them. Something
I will demonstrate to you
very shortly," he added, grinning.</p>

<p>"Say now," nodded Meehan.</p>

<p>"That should be jolly," Forbes
said, laughing courteously.</p>

<p>"I believe it will at that," Heidel
said. "Now if you will notice, gentlemen,"
he said touching the clip
ejector of the pistol and watching
the black magazine slip out into his
other hand. "I have but five cartridges
in the clip. Just five. You
see?"</p>

<p>They all bent forward, blinking.</p>

<p>"Good," said Heidel, shoving the
clip back into the grip of the gun.
He couldn't keep his lips from curling
in his excitement, but his hands
were as steady as though his nerves
had turned to ice.</p>

<p>The five men leaned back in
their chairs.</p>

<p>"Now then, Meehan," he said to
the man at the opposite end of the
table. "Would you mind moving
over to your left, so that the end of
the table is clear?"</p>

<p>"Oh?" said Meehan. "Yes, of
course." He grinned at the others,
and there was a ripple of amusement
as Meehan slid his chair to
the left.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Heidel. "All pretty
foolish-looking, perhaps. But it
won't be in a few minutes when I
discover the bastard of a Martian
who's in this group, I'll tell you
that!" His voice rose and rang in
the room, and he brought the glistening
pistol down with a crack
against the table.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">There was</span> dead silence and
Heidel found his smile again.
"All right, now I'll explain a bit
further. Before Dr. Kingly, the head
of our laboratory, died a few days
ago, he made a very peculiar discovery.
As you know, there has been
no evidence to indicate that the
Martian is any different, physically,
from the Earthman. Not until Dr.
Kingly made his discovery, that is."</p>

<p>Heidel looked from face to face.
"This is how it happened," he went
on. "Dr. Kingly ..."</p>

<p>He paused and glanced about in
false surprise. "I beg your pardon,
gentlemen. We might as well be enjoying
our wine. Excellent port.
Very old, I believe. Shall we?" he
asked, raising his glass.</p>

<p>Five other glasses shimmered in
the candlelight.</p>

<p>"Let us, ah, toast success to the
unveiling of the rotten Martian
who sits among us, shall we?"
Heidel's smile glinted and he drank
a quarter of his glass.</p>

<p>The five glasses tipped and were
returned to the table. Again there
was silence as the men waited.</p>

<p>"To get back," Heidel said, listening
with excitement to his own
voice. "Dr. Kingly, in the process
of an autopsy on a derelict Martian,
made a rather startling discovery ..."</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon," Forbes
said. "Did you say autopsy?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Heidel. "We've done
this frequently. Not according to
base orders, you understand." He
winked. "But a little infraction now
and then is necessary."</p>

<p>"I see," said Forbes. "I just didn't
know about that."</p>

<p>"No, you didn't, did you?" said
Heidel, looking at Forbes closely.
"At any rate, Dr. Kingly had developed
in his work a preserving
solution which he used in such
instances, thereby prolonging the
time for examination of the cadaver,
without experiencing deterioration
of the tissues. This
solution was merely injected into
the blood stream, and ..."</p>

<p>"Sorry again, sir," Forbes said.
"But you said blood stream?"</p>

<p>"Yes," Heidel nodded. "This
had to be done before the cadaver
was a cadaver, you see?"</p>

<p>"I think so, yes," said Forbes,
leaning back again. "Murdered the
bastard for an autopsy, what?"</p>

<p>Heidel's fingers closed around
the pistol. "I don't like that,
Forbes."</p>

<p>"Terribly sorry, sir."</p>

<p>"To get on," Heidel said finally,
his voice a cutting sound. "Dr.
Kingly had injected his solution
and then ... Well, at any rate,
when he returned to his laboratory,
it was night. His laboratory was
black as pitch&mdash;I'm trying to paint
the picture for you, gentlemen&mdash;and
the cadaver was stretched out
on a table, you see. And before Dr.
Kingly switched on the lights, he
saw the eyes of this dead Martian
glowing in the dark like a pair of
hot coals."</p>

<p>"Weird," said Sadler, unblinking.</p>

<p>"Ghostly," said Clarke.</p>

<p>"The important thing," Heidel
said curtly, "is that Dr. Kingly
discovered the difference, then,
between the Martian and the
Earthman. The difference is the
eyes. The solution, you see, had
reacted chemically to the membranes
of the eyeballs, so that as it
happened they lit up like electric
lights. I won't go into what Dr.
Kingly found further, when he dissected
the eyeballs. Let it suffice to
say, the Martian eyeball is a physical
element entirely different from
our own&mdash;at least from those of five
of us, I should say."</p>

<p>His grin gleamed. He was working
this precisely and carefully, and
it was effective. "Now, however,"
he continued, "it is this <i>sixth</i> man
who is at issue right now. The fly
in the soup, shall we say. And in
just a few seconds I am going to
exterminate that fly."</p>

<p>He picked up the pistol from the
table. "As I told you, gentlemen, I
am quite versatile with this weapon.
I am a dead shot, in other
words. And I am going to demonstrate
it to you." He glanced from
face to face.</p>

<p>"You will notice that since Mr.
Meehan has moved, I have a clear
field across the table. I don't believe
a little lead in the woodwork
will mar the room too much, would
you say, Forbes?"</p>

<p>Forbes sat very still. "No, I
shouldn't think so, sir."</p>

<p>"Good. Because I am going to
snuff out each of the four candles
in the center of this table by shooting
the wick away. You follow me,
gentlemen? Locke? Meehan? Sadler?"</p>

<p>Heads nodded.</p>

<p>"Then perhaps you are already
ahead of me. When the last candle
is extinguished, we will have darkness,
you see. And then I think we'll
find our Martian rat. Because, as
a matter of fact," Heidel lolled his
words, "I have taken the privilege
of adding to the wine we have been
drinking Dr. Kingly's preserving solution.
Non-tasteful, non-harmful.
Except, that is, to one man in this
room."</p>

<p>Heidel motioned his gun. "And
God rest the bastard's soul, because
if you will remember, I have five
bullets in the chamber of this pistol.
Four for the candles and one for
the brain of the sonofabitch whose
eyes light up when the last candle
goes out."</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">There was</span> a steady deadly
silence while the flames of the
candles licked at the still air.</p>

<p>"I think, however," Heidel said,
savoring the moment, "that we
should have one final toast before
we proceed." He lifted his glass.
"May the receiver of the fifth bullet
go straight to hell. I phrase that
literally, gentlemen," he said, laughing.
"Drink up!"</p>

<p>The glasses were drained and
placed again on the table.</p>

<p>"Watch carefully," Heidel said
and lifted the pistol. He aimed at
the first candle. The trigger was
taut against his finger, the explosion
loud in the room.</p>

<p>"One," said Heidel.</p>

<p>He aimed again. The explosion.</p>

<p>"Two," he said. "Rather good,
eh?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," Sadler said.</p>

<p>"Quite," said Forbes.</p>

<p>"Again," said Heidel. A third
shot echoed.</p>

<p>"Now," he said, pointing the
muzzle at the last candle. "I would
say this is it, wouldn't you, gentlemen?
And as soon as this one goes,
I'm afraid one of us is going to
find a bullet right between his goddam
sparkling eyes. Are you
ready?"</p>

<p>He squinted one eye and looked
down the sights. He squeezed the
trigger, the room echoed and there
was blackness. Heidel held his pistol
poised over the table.</p>

<p>Silence.</p>

<p>"Well," said Forbes finally.
"There you have it. Surprise,
what?"</p>

<p>Heidel balanced the pistol, feeling
his palm go suddenly moist
against the black grip, and he
looked around at the five pairs of
glowing eyes.</p>

<p>"Bit of a shock, I should imagine,"
Forbes said. "Discovering
all of us, as it were."</p>

<p>Heidel licked his lips. "How?
<i>How</i> could you do this?"</p>

<p>Forbes remained motionless.
"Simple as one, you know. Put men
on rockets going back to Earth in
place of returning colonists. Study.
Observe. Learn. Shift a record here
and there. Forge, change pictures,
all that sort of thing. Poor contact
between here and Earth, you
know. Not too difficult."</p>

<p>"I'll get one of you," Heidel said,
still balancing his pistol tightly.</p>

<p>"Well, possibly," Forbes said.
"But no more than one. You have
three guns pointed at you. We can
see you perfectly, you know, as
though it were broad daylight. One
shiver of that pistol, and you're
dead."</p>

<p>"Why have you done this?"
Heidel said suddenly. "<i>Why?</i>
Everything that was done was for
the Martian. We tried to give you
freedom and culture, the benefit of
our knowledge...."</p>

<p>"We didn't like your wrestlers,"
Forbes said.</p>

<p>Heidel's nostrils twitched, and
suddenly he swung the pistol. There
was a crashing explosion and then
silence.</p>

<p>"Good," said Forbes. "I don't
think he got the last one fired."</p>

<p>"You're all right then?" asked
Meehan, putting his gun on the
table.</p>

<p>"Oh, quite! Rather dramatic altogether,
eh?"</p>

<p>"Nerve tingling," Locke agreed.</p>

<p>Forbes turned in his chair and
called, "Oh, Kessit!"</p>

<p>The butler opened the door to
the darkened room, hesitated, and
reached for the light switch.</p>

<p>"No, no," Forbes said, smiling.
"Never mind that. Come over here,
will you please?"</p>

<p>The butler crossed the room
slowly.</p>

<p>"It's all right," Forbes said. "The
president will notice nothing whatever,
Kessit. Would you mind pouring
us all another glass of wine?
I'm frightfully crazy about that
port, eh?"</p>

<p>There was a murmur of agreeing
voices. The butler lifted the silver
decanter and filled glasses, moving
easily and surely in the darkness.</p>

<p>"Cheers," said Forbes.</p>

<p>"Cheers," said the others, over
the clink of glasses.</p>

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"

Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern

before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity

receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
